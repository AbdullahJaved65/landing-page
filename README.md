# Hello there!

This project although very bare bones, is made with a lot of love... for Demon Slayer!
I love the Demon Slayer and manga and I was thinking about making something related to it. This website is by NO MEAN PERFECT, but it's an effort that I desperately needed to make. I will also add that the page is NOT RESPONSIVE.

# A bit of backstory

I started the project by making (or at least trying to make) exactly how TOP wanted. I created the header and was working on the Hero Section when I got completely stuck.
I got so stuck that I gave up multiple times and just couldn't go continue.

# How did I decided to create this page?

Well, while I was sulking and stressing out about the terribly designed Hero section, I was listening to the Demon Slayer OST and it just popped into my head that I should try and make this website themed!

# How was the overall experience after my decision?

Honestly, this was one the very few time that I got excited about coding something and I probably worked on this for at least 4-5 hours, but it never felt like that at all!

# Resources that made this project what it is.

I'm listing all the links and websites where I got the pictures for this project because with them it would not have been possible.
